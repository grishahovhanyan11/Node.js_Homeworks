Contacts App

Application will have
* Home page(/) - all contacts should be rendered and there should be an "Add contact" button which will redirect to "/new" page. All contacts have "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
* New contact(/contacts/new) page - form for adding a contact with name and phone number
* Edit contact(/contacts/edit/:contactId) page - form with contact data already filled and you can edit and save it, there should be a "Delete" button by clicking it you can delete the selected contact


you should create and use middleware for validating contact data(Validate name as a string with min-length 2 and without any character other than  letter and phone number as an Armenian phone number), use pug for view engine, use the express router.
