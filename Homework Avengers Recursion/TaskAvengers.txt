create 2 arrays: heroes and villains
fill those arrays with 10 characters(objects) with these properties:
  name: somehow generate a random name,
  speed: random number from 1 to 5, 1 means 5 seconds and 5 means the 1-second interval between each attack
  health: equal to 100
  power: random number from 1 to 10,


villains and heroes will attack each other.


all characters start to attack at the same time(first can start villains). Each character hits a random enemy on his turn and the enemy's health decreases by the amount of the character's power.
When a character dies he/she are removed from the array.
Every character makes his next attack after (1/speed * 5 ) seconds.


Write a program to emulate the battle.
Each Attack should be logged.
example:
Thor[90] hits Thanos[100]  with a power of 4.6
Iron-Man dies


At the end of the battle log which team won and stayed characters' health
example:
Heroes win
[Black-Widow[10]  Spider-Man[20] Dr.Strange[5]]
