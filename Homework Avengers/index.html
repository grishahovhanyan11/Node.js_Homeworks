  <div><strong>Create 2 arrays: heroes and villains</strong>
    <p>Fill those arrays with 10 characters(objects) with these properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>name: somehow generate a random name,</li>
      <li>speed: random number from 1 to 5, 1 means 5 seconds and 5 means the 1-second interval between each attack</li>
      <li>health: equal to 100</li>
      <li>power: random number from 1 to 10</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    Villains and heroes will attack each other.
    <p></p>
    All characters start to attack at the same time(first can start villains). Each character hits a random enemy on his
    turn and the enemy's health decreases by the amount of the character's power.<p></p>
    When a character dies he/she are removed from the array.
    Every character makes his next attack after (1/speed * 5 ) seconds.
