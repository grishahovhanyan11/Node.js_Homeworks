  <div><b>Implement a doubly linked list(In console).</b><p></p>
    Like an array, a linked list is a simple linear data structure. Several common data types can be implemented using linked lists, like queues, stacks, and associative arrays.
    A linked list is a collection of data elements called . In a  each node holds a value and a link to the next node. In a  each node also holds a link to the previous node.
    <p></p>    
    Implement a Node to hold a value and pointers to the next and previous nodes. Then implement a List which holds references to the first and last node and offers an array-like interface for adding and removing items:
    <b>push ();
    pop ();
    shift ().
    unshift ();</b>
    <p></p>
    Your list must also implement the following interface:
    <p>delete (delete the first occurrence of a specified value)</p>
    count (count the number of items in the list)</div>
